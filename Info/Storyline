GAMEPLAY
You can fly in a spaceship across the galaxy to any of these planets (very much like Misty Planets did), and land on them. 
You can then play as an iconic character to complete missions on these planets with iconic droids at your side, BB-8, C3PO, and R2-D2.
And the end of each of these missions you'll have to dual a Sith Lord, or something of the like.

So in the start of the game, you'll play as Luke Skywalker with R2-D2, you can then defend Hoth, defeat Jabba on Tatooine, and then 
face Darth Vader and the Emperor. You can also freely explore Tatooine and do other missions to earn coins. 
Once you finish his era, you can move on to Jakku with Rey and BB-8 or to Tatooine (again) with Anakin and C-3PO.
Remember, your character may change depending on what task you have to complete. 

If you're freely exploring, you can switch between the characters and do tasks assigned by the locals in your area.
Coins can be used to by better equipment or upgrade your ship to help you do these. If you complete these tasks, you earn
help tokens. These help tokens can be used to summon help in battle if the character you helped is an "ATTACKER" or
can heal your character if the character you helped is a "HEALER". If the character is a "DISTRACTER", they can give you 10 seconds
where all enemy fire is concentrated at a random point on the screen.

In space, you can get stuck in battles with TIE fighters, the Death Star, StarKiller Base, and other evil ships. 
In these battles, you can fire lasers from your ship, use your hyperdrive engine to fly to a random point on the screen,
or attempt to capture the enemy vessel. If the ship is big enough, you can choose to board it and fight the crew as you would
on a mission. If you lose, you lose the ship you were flying, all of the upgrades you had on currently, and all of your coins.

ATTACKERS
Attackers are characters that have high attack damages and have a lot of health. These characters are easy to get, but hard to help -
If you want to help them to get help tokens, they often request near-impossible tasks.

HEALERS
Healers are characters that have high heal ammounts and average health. These characters are hard to get, yet easy to help - 
If you want to help them to get help tokens, they often request protection from an ATTACKER or for you to find an
ingredient for them to use to make a health potion.

DESTRACTERS
Destracters are characters that have incredible health amounts but often little to no health or attack effects. They do, however, have
a destract function where all enemy fire is concentrated on them. They are great for soaking up damage while facing a dangerous
opponent.

NOTES
All this is loaded in images that are cached, there are loading screens between levels, to reduce lag.
I expect this to be 15,000 - 20,000 lines of code.
