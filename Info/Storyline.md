# Star Wars: The Final Frontier - Storyline

## Gameplay
You can fly in a spaceship across the galaxy to any of these planets (very much like Misty Planets did), and land on them. 
You can then play as an iconic character to complete missions on these planets with iconic droids at your side, BB-8, C3PO, and R2-D2.
And the end of each of these missions you'll have to dual a Sith Lord, or something of the like.

In the start of the game you have a choice to start as the Light side or the Dark side.
You are then given an option to choose one of three paths, the prequels, the original trilogy, or the sequels.
Once you have completed an earlier path, you can move on to a later path.
If you decide to stick around and play through the beginning, you'll receive bonuses later on to make it a more enjoyable experience.
Your game can be saved at any time by clicking the "Save Game" button in-game, thereby printing a code which you can save
for later to pick up where you left off. To load your game, just start up the game and click "Load Game".
You'll be prompted for the code, whereby you will type in your save game code. The game will then reload the same seed gen,
character, progress, and update you stats based off the unique code ID.

This game is completely free play. This still means you have to do certain missions to move on, but you get to decide when
you want to do that, and you get to explore and do other side missions too. You can earn extra coins by doing this, help tokens,
and earn favor for certain factions within the galaxy far far away. This may unlock certain missions later on because of your
reputation with that faction. You can switch between the characters and do tasks assigned by the locals in your area.
Coins can be used to by better equipment or upgrade your ship to help you in battle or reach other destinations required.
Help tokens can be used to summon help in battle if the character you helped is an "ATTACKER", or can heal your character
if the character you helped is a "HEALER". If the character is a "DISTRACTER", they can give you 10 seconds where all
enemy fire is concentrated at a random point on the screen.

In space, you can get stuck in battles with TIE fighters, the Death Star, StarKiller Base, and other evil ships. 
In these battles, you can fire lasers from your ship, use your hyperdrive engine to fly to a random point on the screen,
or attempt to capture the enemy vessel. If the ship is big enough, you can choose to board it and fight the crew as you would
on a mission. If you lose, you lose the ship you were flying, all of the upgrades you had on currently, and all of your coins.

## Notes
1. All this is loaded in images that are cached, there are loading screens between levels, to reduce lag.
2. I expect this to be 15,000 - 20,000 lines of code. @KCF says, "Exactly, maybe more. :/"
3. In the future, there will be a way to choose to go to the Dark Side.
4. The save code may use a series of hexadecimal numbers later depending on the impending situation that we'll need it in.

## How
Start off by choosing your ship. Then, attempt to navigate between the asteroids to get to your location using the map. If you run into an enemy ship, you have multiple options.

1. #### Surrender
If you do this, you lose that ship, but you won't take any damage.

2. #### Attack
You can attack by pressing the spacebar and aiming your ship so that the lasers are focused on the enemy ship.

3. #### Defend
You can turn on your shield for up to 30 seconds, where you will be protected. Note - you can't move during this time. Activate by pressing the "S" key.

4. #### Escape
You can try to out-manuver their ship and escape to your planet. Steer using the arrow keys.

5. #### Hyperdrive
The hyperdrive is really dangerous. It transports you to a random point on the board. Sounds cool, right? Well, if you travel inside a planet, you die, and you have a chance of spawning within enemy territory.

6. #### Board
If you board the enemies ship, you can attempt to loot all of their resources. However, this is dangerous, as you will face multiple battles in a row and won't get healed after each one. If you manage to get to the center of the ship, you can collect bounty for every member of the enemy crew.

## Types of Characters
1. #### Attackers
    Attackers are characters that have high attack damages and have a lot of health. These characters are easy to get, but hard to help -
    If you want to help them to get help tokens, they often request near-impossible tasks.

2. #### Healers
    Healers are characters that have high heal ammounts and average health. These characters are hard to get, yet easy to help - 
    If you want to help them to get help tokens, they often request protection from an ATTACKER or for you to find an
    ingredient for them to use to make a health potion.

3. #### Distracters
Distracters are characters that have incredible health amounts but often little to no health or attack effects. They do, however, have
a distract function where all enemy fire is concentrated on them. They are great for soaking up damage while facing a dangerous
opponent.

4. #### Bosses
Bosses are characters that have multiple talents. One such example would be General Grevious - he has amazing health, and incredible attack. He also has a 50% chance to focus all enemy fire on him. This means that they are incredibly difficult to defeat.

5. #### Supporters
Supporters are characters that can protect a character and maximize their attack. Supporters have really low health, but are a great addition to your team.

6. #### Blockers
Blockers are temporary characters that can walk across the screen. They have infinite health, and can protect a character from either side from getting hurt.

## How
You start off in a 3D scenic area. Once a character's turn bar is filled up, that character can do its stuff.
If a character on your team has a full attack bar, you can click on him/her and select which move you would like to do.
If an enemy has a full attack bar, they will automatically attack.
If your characters all have 0% health, you lose.
