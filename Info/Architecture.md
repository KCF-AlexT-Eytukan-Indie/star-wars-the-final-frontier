# Architecture

Here we're figuring out how we want to structure our program to work the fastest through an OOP approach.

1. Cache**
  * Bitmap
  * Sounds
2. Entity
  * Draw
  * Player
   *  Update
  * Enemy
   *  Update
3. Map
  * Generation
  * Save
4. GameHandler
  * Update

**We are currently going to be using the Bitmap strategy to do our program.
