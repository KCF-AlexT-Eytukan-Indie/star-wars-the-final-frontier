# Architecture

Here we're figuring out how we want to structure our program to work the fastest through an OOP approach.

1. Bitmap**
  * Draw
  * Cache
2. Entity
  * Update
  * CollideWith
  * Draw
3. Map
  * Generation
  * Save
4. GameHandler
  * Update

**We are currently going to be using the Bitmap strategy to do our program.
